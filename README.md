# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Description
 note-taking application
 I open the Note Taker and i am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.
 I click on the link to the notes page and I
 am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
 I enter a new note title and the note’s text is then saved and a
 icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
 I click on the Save icon the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
 I can click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
